# Boilerplate

This repository is an empty boilerplate for [this]() tutorial.

## Requirements
Make sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) installed on your local machine, and that you know your way around the terminal.

## Get started

To get started, replace the `Your\\Namespace\\` key in the [`composer.json`](composer.json) with the namespace you want to use.

Once you have done this, run the following command in your terminal:
```shell
$ composer install
```

When you want to run the tests you have written, just run:
```shell
$ php vendor/bin/phpunit
```

You're now ready to start developing!
